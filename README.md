# Setup Practice Environment

The files you need for following my Data Analyst Portfolio projects are:

- Power BI Desktop - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/desktop
- SQL Server Express Edition - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads
- SQL Server Management Studio (SMSS) - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16
- AdventuerWorksDW2022.bak - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms

The Adventureworks file is only for demonstrating how to restore a .bak file to SQL Server Management Studio, but it can also be useful to have it as it is a database with tables you can query and practice SQL on.
